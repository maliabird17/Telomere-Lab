A2m,Alpha-2-M,alpha-2-macroglobulin,"Is able to inhibit all four classes of proteinases by a unique 'trapping' mechanism. This protein has a peptide stretch, called the 'bait region' which contains specific cleavage sites for different proteinases. When a proteinase cleaves the bait region, a conformational change is induced in the protein which traps the proteinase. The entrapped enzyme remains active against low molecular weight substrates (activity against high molecular weight substrates is greatly reduced). Following cleavage in the bait region, a thioester bond is hydrolyzed and mediates the covalent binding of the protein to the proteinase.",others,"Mus musculus","The primary sequence and the subunit structure of mouse alpha-2-macroglobulin, deduced from protein sequencing of the isolated subunits and from molecular cloning of the cDNA",10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb17424.x,unknown,Unknown,232345
Abl1,"Abelson Tyrosine-Protein Kinase 1","c-abl oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase","Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase that plays a role in many key processes linked to cell growth and survival such as cytoskeleton remodeling in response to extracellular stimuli, cell motility and adhesion, receptor endocytosis, autophagy, DNA damage response and apoptosis. Coordinates actin remodeling through tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins controlling cytoskeleton dynamics like WASF3 (involved in branch formation); ANXA1 (involved in membrane anchoring); DBN1, DBNL, CTTN, RAPH1 and ENAH (involved in signaling); or MAPT and PXN (microtubule-binding proteins).","genomic instability","Mus musculus","Functional interaction between DNA-PK and c-Abl in response to DNA damage",10.1038/386732a0,mmu04110,"Cell cycle",11350
